# My First React Project: Portfolio Page

This is my first React project where I built a simple portfolio page. The goal was to practice React fundamentals and experiment with styling using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- ðŸ’» React Components: Created reusable components to build the layout.
- ðŸŽ¨ Tailwind CSS: Used Tailwind for quick styling and responsive design.
- ðŸš€ Fast & Mobile-Responsive: Optimized the page for a smooth experience across devices.

## Project Details

I started by building a portfolio page using React, with an emphasis on breaking the page down into reusable components. I integrated Tailwind CSS to quickly prototype the design, ensuring that the page is responsive and user-friendly.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
